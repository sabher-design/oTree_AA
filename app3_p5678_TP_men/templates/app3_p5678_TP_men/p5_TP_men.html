    <p>
    <b> <u>Color:</u> </b> Each participant is randomly assigned to one of two groups, the Green Group or the Blue Group. 
    This assignment remains the same throughout the study, that is, for all six tournaments. Half of the participants will be in the Green Group. 
    The other half will be in the Blue Group.  </p>

    <p><b>You belong to the XX Group. </b></p>

 
    <p> During each round of the tournament, you will complete the word encoding task for 5 minutes. 
        Your earnings in each round will depend on what we call “final performance”. 
        It consists of the number of correctly encoded words times a multiplier. 
        Participants in the Green Group have a multiplier of 0.9. Participants in the Blue Group have a multiplier of 1.
     </p>
 
    <p>For example, if you are in the Green Group and you encode 10 words correctly, your final performance is 10 x 0.9 = 9 words. 
       If you are in the Blue Group and you encode 10 words correctly, your final performance is 10 x 1 = 10 words.
     </p>
         
     <p> Since you are in the Blue Group your final performance is: </p>
        
      <p>Final performance = 1 x total number of correctly encoded words in five minutes
         </p>
