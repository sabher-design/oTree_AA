The Word Encoding Task
{% endblock %}
 

{% block content %}
<p>In the tournament, you will complete a word encoding task. Before we explain the details of the tournament, 
	you will have 2 minutes to try out the task yourself. 
</p>

<p> In the task, you will see a number of words and your task will be to encode these words by
	 substituting the letters of the alphabet with numbers using a table like this:
</p>
<br>
   <img width="80%" height="80%" alt="Examplary Task" src="{% static "task.PNG" %}"/>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Example: You are given the word DAI. The letters in the table show that D=285, A=289, and I=978.</p>

<p>
Once you encode a word correctly, the computer will prompt you with another word which you will be asked to encode. 
Once you encode that word, you will be given another word and so on. </p>

<p>
You may now try the task yourself for 2 minutes. The remaining time is displayed at the top of your screen. 
The time starts once you click “Next”.
